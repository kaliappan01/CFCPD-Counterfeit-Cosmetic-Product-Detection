# Counterfeit Cosmetic Product Detection  

## PROJECT IDEA
The main objective is to design an web application CFCPD (CounterFeit Cosmetic
Product Detection) using Blockchain technology which is capable of tracing
cosmetic products throughout the supply chain to combat the issues of fake
cosmetic products. By using Blockchain’s decentralized and transparency
properties, and the assurance that each record cannot be forged on the Blockchain,
consumers don’t need to fully rely on the middleman or distributors to check the
authenticity of the purchased product but can also trace the product from the origin
to the destination themselves. Thus, our project will preserve the integrity of
original products and provide reliability during the entire supply chain process.  
## IMPACT ON SOCIETY  
In recent times, the number of counterfeit products being sold on e-commerce sites is on
the rise and as a result, counterfeiting is becoming an industry in and of itself. Counterfeit
merchandise, including cosmetics, continues to permeate all aspects of e-commerce and
it’s no surprise that luxury brands are among the worst affected. A lot of investment is
being put into these luxury products, which results in counterfeiters taking advantage of
their popularity. These fake products, particularly counterfeit cosmetics, can even be
highly dangerous to consumers. We thereby proposed a solution that will allow key
information of supply chain production and circulation to be stored on the blockchain to
ensure that the information cannot be tampered. Ultimately, these technologies will
improve efficiency, reduce errors and broaden accessibility to a supply system that is now
more representative of the digital age.  
## NOVELTY  
The project proposes a new age solution which uses a blend of both Blockchain &
Decentralized Applications to solve the problem. To tamper information present on
Blockchain is nearly impossible .Detection of counterfeit products by inspection is
a very tedious task, this project brings an innovative and effective way to solve this
problem.  
## EFFECTIVE IMPACT OF OUR PROJECT  
The Supply Chain of cosmetic products will be transparent and the
information cannot be tampered by any means, because of Blockchain thus
preventing the flow of counterfeit products. Also the Web application will be
a user-friendly software.  
## DETAILS ABOUT THE PROJECT    
Our solution is a Web application; that will allow the details of the product’s
supply chain to be stored digitally on Decentralized storage with every record
stored on the Ethereum blockchain. Our solution is to design a framework
consisting of Manufacturer, Distributor/Retailer, and consumer. The details of
the product flow between these three members will be kept transparent

In the above displayed use case diagram, there are mainly three types of users namely Manufacturer, Retailer/Distributor and Consumer. Every user first has to register into the system. The roles and features of the users are as follows: 
  
   The Manufacturer’s responsibilities: 
  Adding the products into the system
  Scan Shipment
  Check Product Details
  Keep a track of the product purchased
   Retailer’s/Distributor’s responsibilities are:
  Scan Shipment
  Sell Product
  Check Product Details
  Keep a track of the product purchased
   Consumer’s responsibilities are:
Check product details
Keep a track of the product purchased
Verify the origin of product
